# Work-Samples-And-Resources

The goal of this repo is essentially to show off some of the past work I have done, as well as provide motivation for future analyses.
In addition, I have also attached a couple of R Studio "cheatsheets" that cover essential R packages I have found useful in my work- one covering data manipulation with the dplyr and tidyr and one covering data visualizations with ggplot2.
Please send me an e-mail at thomas.fleming@duke.edu if you have any questions about any of the analyses or a request for any future work.
